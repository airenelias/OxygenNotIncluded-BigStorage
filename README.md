BigStorage

Rebalancing and beautifying of Big Storage mod by roj42. One more attempt at larger storage with actual balance, just more suited for my personal taste.
Includes bigger, smarter and prettier storage bins, liquid and gas reservoirs at higer capacity but higher cost. Each one with its own unique and beautiful (hopefully) look.

NotTooFast

This mod reduces all walking/climbing animation speeds by half, making them less seizure-causing.
